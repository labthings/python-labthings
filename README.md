## Acknowledgements

Much of the code surrounding default response formatting has been liberally taken from [Flask-RESTful](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful). The integrated [Marshmallow](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow) support was inspired by [Flask-Marshmallow](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/flask-marshmallow) and [Flask-ApiSpec](https://github.com/jmcarp/flask-apispec).
