This submodule is a modified version of fuhrysteve/marshmallow-jsonschema, with slightly differing and reduced functionality.

This will convert any Marshmallow schema into a JSON schema, without any schema references or additional properties. 
It will create a basic, inline schema only.

It has also been modified (with the addition of `.base.convert_type_list_to_oneof`) to avoid returning list values for
the type of a schema (this is valid JSON schema, but is not permitted in Thing Description syntax).  Instead, we expand
the list, by creating a copy of the schema for each type, and combining them using `oneOf`.  This means that
`fields.String(allow_none=True)`, which would previously be rendered as:
```json
{"type": ["string", "null"]}
```
will be dumped as
```json
{
    "oneOf": [
        {"type": "string"},
        {"type": "null"}
    ]
}
```
This is also valid JSONSchema, though clearly less elegant.  However, it's required by the thing description.
